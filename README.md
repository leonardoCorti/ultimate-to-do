# Ultimate Todo

WiP!

Ultimate Todo is an open-source, self-hostable task manager that aims to fill the gap for a open source to-do list application thats easy to sync with other platforms and services while providing uniform interfaces across various platforms. Inspired by Todoist and Taskwarrior, this project strives to offer a fast, ubiquitous, and easily synchronizable task management solution without the limitations of proprietary services.
