# Utd - Ubiquitous To-Do Gui for Android
WiP!

## status
this project is in its very early stages, there is nothing done yet.

## goal
The goal is to develop an Android application that serves as a primary interface for interacting with the Utd - Ubiquitous To-Do ecosystem when on mobile.

In the future I would like to support also IOS, but currently I will focus on hardware that I can test on and share the program for without too much hassle.
