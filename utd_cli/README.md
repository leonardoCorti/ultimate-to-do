# Utd - Ubiquitous To-Do CLI
WiP!

## status
this project is in its very early stages, there is nothing done yet.

## goal
The CLI will be the core interface during the initial development phase, as it allows for faster iteration and modification. The first goal is to create a task management system similar to Taskwarrior, using a YAML file as the backend.

## example
```bash
utd add a very important task
utd add a very important task -p 1 -P my_project -d 2025/01/03 -T a_tag -T another_tag 
utd list 
utd done 1
utd edit 1
```
