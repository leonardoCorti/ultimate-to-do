# Ultimate To-Do CLI
WiP!

this project is very early, there is nothing done yet.

The idea for this cli is to be the main way to interact with the system at least in the first phase of the development as it will be the easier to develop and modify.

Now the target is to have a base impelmentation of a task-warrior style cli using as back-end a yaml file.

## example
utd add a very important task
utd add a very important task -p 1 -P my_project -d 2025/01/03 -T a_tag -T another_tag 
utd list 
utd done 1
utd edit 1
