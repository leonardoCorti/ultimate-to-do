# Ultimate To-Do Web application
WiP!

this project is very early, there is nothing done yet.

the idea for this web app is to have a way to access your projects when you are on a computer where you can't or don't want to install a program.

the idea is to make it confiurable so that it can interact with the utd-server hosted on the same machine or to be used standalone using browser local storage.
